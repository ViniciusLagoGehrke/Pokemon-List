# Web applicationüõ†

The web application is composed by a screen that shows the entire list of
Pokemon TCG cards from an external API, allowing the user to go inside each
card for more details.
We will be fetching the data from the Pok√©mon TCG Developers API
(https://pokemontcg.io/).
Take into account the architecture you use, we will be evaluating it üßê.

others are optional and the remainder are considered as going the extra mile.

## Running Scripts

You can open a new shell window by hitting command+shift+S on macOS or control+shift+S (you can also access shortcuts from the `?` in the bottom right corner).

When in the shell you can run any of the following scripts:

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
